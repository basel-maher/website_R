abstract: Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and an increased risk of fracture. Traits contributing to osteoporotic fracture are highly heritable, indicating that a comprehensive understanding of bone requires a thorough understanding of the genetic basis of bone traits. Towards this goal, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified over 500 loci associated with bone traits. However, few of the responsible genes have been identified, and little is known of how these genes work together to influence systems-level bone function. In this review, we describe how systems genetics approaches can be used to fill these knowledge gaps.

summary: Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD) and an increased risk of fracture. Traits contributing to osteoporotic fracture are highly heritable, indicating that a comprehensive understanding of bone requires a thorough understanding of the genetic basis of bone traits. Towards this goal, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified over 500 loci associated with bone traits. However, few of the responsible genes have been identified, and little is known of how these genes work together to influence systems-level bone function. In this review, we describe how systems genetics approaches can be used to fill these knowledge gaps.
